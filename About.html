            <p>Hi! My Name is Fardinuzzaman Tazim. I'm a 16 year old teenager Web and Graphic Designer from Bangladesh.
                Currently I'm studying in 8th grade at SOS Hermann Gmeiner College. I was worked in "Volunteer for Bangladesh" as a Volunteer Graphic Designer. 
                It was tough for me as a beginner, but after struggling 3 months I was elected as a "BEST GRAPHIC DESIGNER OF THE MONTH" in "Volunteer for Bangladesh" on April 2020. 
                That's how my Graphic Designning started in my teenager life. After that then I got addicted about Web Designing. This is my first attempt that you have currently visited.
                 I created my this portfolio after getting inspiration from Youtube's Course Video. In my leisure time I work for creating new type website, learning about<span class="highlight-word-color"> HTML</span> and <span2 class="highlight-word-color-2"> CSS</span2>. And also try to improve my skill. </p>
